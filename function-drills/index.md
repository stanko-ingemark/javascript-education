# Intro

The idea here is to have a series of drills (like for playing a sport or an instrument) which would help the user become very comfortable with the idea of high order functions and callbacks in javascript.

When working with any function, we should always be clear of the function _signature_ - that is, what arguments it expects (type and number), and what is the return value (type).
This is much more obvious in Typescript, but in Javascript we have to pay attention a bit more (which leads to great rewards in the future :) ). 

These are not competition assignments - generally, solutions should be as simple as possible. Don't worry about edge conditions - if it works as shown in the example it should be good enough (unless otherwise specified in the description).
